To run the program compile all files. Then run the command:<br>
java Main \<airports-csv\> \<directions-csv\> \<weather-csv\> \<missions-in\> \<task1-out\> \<task2-out\> <br>
It may be better to use absolute paths for files. <br>
Airports files are designed in a way such that they contain the airports from one continent. Inter airport files contains airports from different continents. There is a weather in each airfield and it affects the cost of the flight and weather changes with time. Task1 is a simplified version of task2. In task1 fligths do not take time. In task2 flights take time according to distance. Planes can park at an airport and parking has also a cost that is different for each airport. If parking along the way is more profitable than planes will park and wait for the weather conditions to change.
